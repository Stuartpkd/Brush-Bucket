# BrushBucket - A digital brush Ecommerce site.

## Introduction

This is my coding repository dedicated to the BrushBucket website. It is an e-commerce platform designed for digital artists and enthusiasts, focusing on the sale of Procreate brushes. BrushBucket began as an idea for a community-driven site where users could share and explore digital brushes. Due to project scope and technical considerations, it has evolved into a marketplace for purchasing, downloading, and rating a diverse range of digital brushes. One of the key features of the project is utilizing AWS for secure and efficient storage of the digital brush files, which ensures a smooth user experience in accessing and using these creative tools. This platform not only enhances the digital art experience for its users but also stands as a testament to the integration of artistic creativity with cutting-edge web technology.
